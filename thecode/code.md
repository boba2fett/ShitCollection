# The Code

- No Excuses
- No sacrifice too great
- The world owes you nothing
- Life decreases
- Talk is cheap, show me the code
- I do not care
- Everyone has their own view of world and how it works
- Legends are dead and yet they never die
- Crap in crap out
- No pain, no gain
- Power poisons

**This is the way**
